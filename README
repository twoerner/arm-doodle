This repository contains a bunch of my ARM doodles. In other words, if I read
something interesting or want to try out something related to ARM this is
where I'll put it.

On my actual checkout I have a directory called 'local' under which is a
directory called 'packages'. In packages I have unpacked a number of different
Mentor/Code Sourcery "lite" toolchains. I determine which of the toolchains is
currently in use by using 'stow' to populate the 'local' directory with the
chosen toolchain's contents. So as long as my environment points to the
'local/bin' directory I'll be using the current toolchain.
